### Singlet Triplet Inversion

Certain molecules can display a phenomenon called singlet-triplet inversion, in which the triplet state actually becomes higher in energy than the singlet state, exceptions to Hund's rule. Such molecules exhibit properties like thermally activated delayed fluorescence, vital for more efficient OLEDs.

Using quantum mechanical calculations, I investigated photophysical properties that enable singlet-triplet inversions: exchange energy and electron correlation strengths. Most of this was done with QChem and Gaussian computational methods. I also wrote scripts to analyze orbital geometries and point group symmetries for a heuristic approach at understanding exchange energies. We're currently looking to publish our findings.

In addition, I corresponded with Professor Leonardo Sousa of the Technical University of Denmark to set up his photophysical software package, NEMO, at Osaka University. By harnessing  nuclear ensemble methods, I ran calculations for emission spectra, transition rates, and photoluminescent quantum yields. These results supported experimental findings regarding novel molecules.

I appreciate the NSF for funding this fellowship and amazing experience.
