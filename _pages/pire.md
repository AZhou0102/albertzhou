### Singlet Triplet Inversion

Recall Hund's Rule, which asserts that states of higher spin multiplicity correspond to lower energies. Certain molecules can display a phenomenon called singlet-triplet inversion, in which the triplet state actually becomes higher in energy than the singlet state, circumventing Hund's rule. Such molecules exhibit properties like thermally activated delayed fluorescence, vital to making more efficient OLEDs.

Using quantum mechanical calculations, I investigated photophysical properties that enable singlet-triplet inversions: exchange energy and electron correlation strengths. Most of this was done with QChem and Gaussian computational methods. Furthermore, I wrote scripts to analyze molecular topologies and point group symmetries for a heuristic approach at understanding exchange energies. We're currently looking to publish our findings.

In addition, I also corresponded with Professor Leonardo E. Sousa of the Technical University of Denmark to help the lab group set up his photophysical software package, NEMO. By harnessing these nuclear ensemble methods, I subsequently ran calculations for emission spectra, transition rates, and photoluminescent quantum yields. These results allowed for graduate student Reo Kurihara to contextualize his experimental results, for the same novel molecules. 

I appreciate the NSF for funding this fellowship and amazing experience.
