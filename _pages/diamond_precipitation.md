### Diamond Rain on Exoplanets

I spent a summer researching diamond precipitation dynamics, aka *diamond rain*, in exoplanet settings by modeling extreme-pressure equations of state.
  This was done via recursive computational methods, in which exoplanetary composition was used to determine internal pressure-density profiles. 
  My algorithm was based on a numerical procedure, bouncing back and forth between the Adams-Williamson equation and various EoS's (e.g. Vinet, Birch-Murnaghan, Holzapfel).
  Using Monte Carlo simulations, we were able to profile exoplanets that are likely candidates for diamond precipitation.
  In addition to sounding cool, studying diamond rain helps us understand high density physics with significant applications spanning nuclear fusion, planetary formation, and astrobiology.

Thank you to the Department of Energy for funding this project.
